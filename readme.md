## axi_stream_to_ddr
This projects demonstrates using the Xilinx AXI Datamover core to stream data to and from a DDR memory.

Versions are written for the Digilent Arty A7-35T board and the ALINX AXAU15 board.

A controller manipulates the Datamover core to fill the DDR memory and read it back.

ILA cores are installed to observe the data traffic.

The Arty version has been heavily tested.

Good luck.
